File Loading order: personal/preload/ -> core/ -> prelude-modules.el -> personal/
In personal/preload/ loading phase, you cannot touch third-party packages,
so you should write any package related configs in personal/ directory.

Started up again, cloning prelude directly into .emacs.d and then linking in just my
config, and still same b/s as far as not seeming to load my config consistently. Will have to
come back to it. If it's broken the same way and to the same degree either way, I might as
well keep prelude in my lib directory and go back to linking just what I use.
