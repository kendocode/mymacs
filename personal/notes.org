Prelude File Loading order: personal/preload/ (in alpha order) -> core/ -> prelude-modules.el -> personal/(alpha order)

In personal/preload/ loading phase, no access to prelude packages.

* Installing Org

** Use Latest version from org's archive
   made load-org.el file in personal/preload to add org's archive to archive list. Evaled buffer,
then was able to install org-plus-contrib via M-x package install.

** Add my config on top of Prelude's
   Copied the basic prelude org config into mine so I remember what's used. Now I can require org
from prelude-modules.el, and everything should work.  [[https://orgmode.org/elpa.html][Org site]] suggests initializing packages early
in emacs init and only installing before any org files are visited etc, but reading prelude package
loading code it looks to be acceptable as is.
